# Basics of a Neuron:

The brain is the most complex organ in the human body. It is made up of billions of specialized cells, including neurons, the cells which transmit and receive information and signals, glia, which perform multiple support functions as well as contributing to signaling and other cells that make up the blood vessels and other structural elements.   
Neurons are responsible for communicating information via electrical impulses and chemical signals within the brain and to other parts of the body. These impulses and signals allow us to move our muscles, receive sensory input, and distinguish our thoughts.

**Neuron structure:**

Each neuron is composed of several different parts. The neucleus, which is located inside the cell body called the soma, contains the cell's genetic material and is responsible for controlling the cell. Dendrites are branch-like structures that project out of neuron and taper towards the end. The axon is a thin, cylindrical projection from the cell body that resembles a tail. The axon also splits into multiple branches, each of which have an ending called an axon terminal, where the transfer of information from once cell to another takes place. Neurons have only one axon and most neurons have multiple dendrites.

**Neuron function:**

Although dendrites and axons are similar structurally in the way they project off the soma, they are functionally opposite. Dendrites receive input, while axons transmit output. The junction between the axon terminal of one cell and a dendrite of another is referred to as a synapse. The synapse is where the chemical transmission of information occurs.

**Action potentials and neurotransmitters:**

All cells have a cell membrane that forms a boundary between the inside of the cell and the outside environment, with neurons being no exception. Neurons are electrically charged and the inside of the neuron has a different electrical charge than the outside of the neuron. This difference in voltage is called the membrane potential.  
If threshold potential is not reached, an action potential is not triggered. Once triggered an action potential is always the same shape and size and follows the same sequence of steps, rising in voltage followed by returning to the resting potential. This is why action potentials are referred to as all-or-none signals.   
Ions flow into and out of the cell through openings called ion channels. When an action potential commences, ion channels open and allow positively charged sodium ions to flow into the neuron due to the negative potential inside the neuron and the high concentration of sodium ions outside the cell.

**Synaptic Potential:**

As an action potential travels down an axon and causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft, the neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the postsynaptic cell, resulting in an influx of positive ions. The change in the postsynaptic cell's polarity that occurs as a result of this influx of ions called a synaptic potential.   
A neuron is usually connected to several other neurons in a network.If the synaptic potential from a single presynaptic cell always generated an action potential in a postsynaptic cell, given that neurons are arranged in a web-like structure with one neuron connecting to many others, too much neuronal firing would occur. The majority of synaptic potentials are below threshold and do not trigger an action potential.
`there are two types of synaptic potentials:` Excitatory postsynaptic potentials, which increases the probability of an action potential firing, and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials which decreases the likelihood of an action potential occurring.    

**Miniature Postsynaptic Potentials:**

When an action potential fires, many vesiclesfuse with the cell membrane and release neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft, resulting in a synaptic potential. Occasionally, only a single vesicle will fuse to the presynaptic membrane spontaneously in the absence of an action potential. When its transmitter is released and binds to the postsynaptic receptors, a small membrane potential change occurs, called a miniature postsynaptic potential.

**Voltage-clamp Recording:**

To be able to measure miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials, it is necessary to prevent the occurrence of action potentials, which can be done using a technique called voltage-clamp recording. In a two-electrode voltage clamp, one electrode measures the cell membrane potential, and one injects current, positive or negative electrical charges into the cell.   
This technique allows the cell's internal voltage to be held constant as well as measure the amount of current needed to hold the voltage constant.

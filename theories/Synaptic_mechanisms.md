# Basic Synaptic mechanisms and dendritic processing

### Chemical synapses and neurotransmitters:

Chemical synapses are the workhorses of neuronal information transfer in the mammalian nervous system. They consist of a specialized extension on an axon, the axon terminal and specific receiving sites on dendrites.

**Neurotransmitters:**

Axon terminals of chemical synapses have the ability to synthesize special chemicals called neurotransmitters, concentrated and stored in synaptic vesicles. The arrival of an action potential triggers the probabilistic release of neurotransmitters. Released neurotransmistters drift across the synaptic cleft, a small gap of only a few micrometers between the axon terminal and the dendrite of the postsynaptic neuron.

Common Neurotransmitters in CNS are:
* Glutamate (Glu).
* Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
* Dopamine (DA).
* Acetylcholine (ACh).

Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels are special types of ion channels in postsynaptic dendrites that open and close under the regulation of neurotransmitters. The response in the membrane potential is called the postsynaptic potential or the PSP.  
Receptors that are tightly coupled to an ion channel are called ionotropic.

**Ion pumps:**

Repeated generation of action potentials results in a repeated efflux of K+ and influx of Na+. If a neuron repeated the process, many times, it would decrease the potassium concentration and increase the sodium concentration within the cell repeatedly, eventually leading to the failure to generate action potentials. Another type of ion channels are called the ion pumps. It can transfer specific ions against their concentration level between the inside and outside of neurons. 

**Propagation of action potentials:**

Once an action potential is initiated, it will rapidly increase the membrane potential of neighbouring axon sites and thus travel along the axon with a low speed. This form of signal transportation within an active membrane is loss-free. The signal is regenerated at each point of the axon membrane and the signal will not deteriorate with distance.

Different spiking characteristics:
* Regular spiking neurons
* Fast spiking neurons
* Continuously spiking neurons
* Intrinsic bursting neurons

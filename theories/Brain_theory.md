## Basics of Brain theory:

### Level of analysis:
David Marr and tomaso poggio realized that usefulness of distinguishing between different levels of description when explaining processes.  
Besides these important considerations for any explanatory theory, Marr made an important distinction between different levels of analysis, These are:

1. Computational theory
2. Representation and algorithm
3. Hardware implementation

```To phrase the matter in another way, an algorithm is likely to be understood more readily by understanding the nature of the problem being solved than by examining the mechanism in which it is emboided```

*The brain produces goal-directed behaviour to maximize our probability of survival.*   
The theory is that fast preception can only be achieved through foreknowledge and that the human brain functions as a predictive or anticipatory memory system. The brief version:  
*The brain is an anticipating memory system that learns to represent expectations of the world, which can be used to generate goal-directed behaviour.*


### Biological Background:

The central nervous system or the CNS is primarily made up of two principal cell types, neurons and glial cells. Glial cells far outnumber neurons and while glial cells have been seen as mainly providing supporting functions, there is increasing evidence of many more active processing functions of different types of glial cells.  
Neurons are biological cells and therefore have common features of other cells, including a cell body, a nucleus containing DNA, ribosomes assembling proteins from genetic instructions and mitochondria providing energy for the cell.In contrast to other cells, neurons specialize in signal processing utilizing special electrophysical and chemical processes.

#### Structural properties:

The major structural features are a cell body and root-like extensions called neurites. The neurites are further distinguished into the receiving fibres of neurons called dendrites and one major outgoing trunk called an axon.   

Some examples of shapes of neurons are: Pyramidal cell, Granule cell, Spiny cell, Purkinje cell.
The most abundant neocortical neurons are categorized into pyramidal and stellate neurons.

## Associative memory and Hebbian learning:

We can loosely differentiate two forms of plasticity:
* Structural plasticity: It is the mechanism describing the generation of new connections and thereby redefining the toplogy of the network.
* Functional plasticity: It is the mechanism of changing strength values of existing connections.

### Hebbian learning:

Functional implementation of learning:

```When an axon of a cell A is near enough to excite cell B or repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth or metabolic change takes place in both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.```

Hebb had no means of observing synapses directly, which makes this hypothesis a wild guess by our standards.    
Activity-dependent plasticity that depends on pre- and postsynaptic activity is often called Hebbian plasticity or Hebbian learning in Hebb's honour.

### Associations:

Synaptic plasticity is the necessary ingedient behind forming associations.     
*Increase the strength of the synapses by a value $del w$ = 0.1 if a presynaptic firing is paired with a postsynaptic firing.* 

This learning rule modifies the synaptic weights, so that after one simultaneous presentation of two or more stimuli, the respective cue, will find it.

Although the synaptic strengths of input channels change with the learning rule, we call the initial stimulus the unconditioned stimulus because the response of the neuron to this stimulus was maintained. For the second input the response of the neuron changes during learning, and so we call the second stimulus the conditioned stimulus.

# Brief about Hodgkin-Huxley model:

In 1952, Hodgkin and Huxley described the underlying mechanism for the firing of action potentials through which information is propagated in the nervous system.
Hodgkin and Huxley's model relies on the opening and closing of channels, selectively allowing ions to move across the membrane.The channels open independenty of one another.

> Action potentials arise from the synergistic action of sodium channels and potassium channels, each of which opens and closes in a voltage dependent fashion.A key feature of the model is that the channels open independently of each other, the probability that a channel is open depends only on the membrane voltage history.

### Key points to ponder:
* The HH spiking neuron model reproduces the dynamic characteristics of the neuron by mimicking the action potential, ionic channels and spiking behaviors.
* The neuron cell membrane is a voltage-gated ion channel, which has high selectivity for the permeability of external and internal ions in body fluid. Only one type of ion can pass through specific channels. 
* There involves four ionic components, sodium, potassium, calcium and chloride
* the transmembrane current depends on the rapid inward current caused by sodium and the slow outward current caused by potassium
* When the sodium channels are opened, the high concentration sodium flows from extracellular to intracellular, the depolarization is produced, the action potential is generated. And then, the sodium channels are closed, and the potassium channels are opened, the potassium permeates from intracellular to extracellular, the repolarization is performed
* In the HH model, the conductance value of each ion channel is decided by the gate-controlled variables m,n,h.

### Phases:
1. Cole and Curtis demonstrated that the action potential is associated with a large increase in membrane conductance
2. Hodgkin and huxley made the first intracellular recording of an action potential.
3. hodgkin and Katz explained the overshooting action potential by showing that it results from an increase in socium permeability.
4. Finally, hodgkin, Huxley and Katz developed a voltage-clamp circuit to enable quantitative measurement of ionic currents from squid axon.

HH then showed that step depolarizations of the squid axon trigger an inward current folloowed by an outward current.

#### The Voltage Clamp Technique:
By making use of the voltage clamp technique and its associated estimation method, the parameters of an ionic channel can be identified one by one. 
The **voltage clamp** is a classic electrophysiological technique to measure ion currents across the cell membrane. under voltage clamp conditions, voltage-gated ion channels open and close as normal, but the voltage clamp apparatus compensates for the changes in the ion current to maintain a constant membrane potential.
